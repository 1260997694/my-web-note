### 浏览器内存限制
Browser limitations on per-tab memory are not well documented.    
The 64-bit Chrome browsers are known to have a 4Gb per-tab memory limit.   
iOS devices have more stringent limitations: empirical evidence indicates that    
the iPhone 6 is limited to 645Mb, the iPhone 6s to 1Gb, and the iPhone 7 to 2Gb.
